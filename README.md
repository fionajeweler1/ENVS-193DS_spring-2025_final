# ENVS-193DS_spring-2025_final
Final assignment for ENVS 193DS, Spring 2025

## General Information
This repository contains my final assignment for ENVS 193DS, Spring 2025 at UC Santa Barbara. The project demonstrates my ability to organize and present environmental data using reproducible workflows in Quarto and RStudio. This assignment builds on skills learned in previous workshops and lectures, and includes data wrangling, analysis, and final rendered outputs.

## Data and File Overview

- **Code folder**:  
  Contains the Quarto document `ENVS-193DS_spring-2025_final.qmd`, which includes all R code, analysis, and figures.  
  The rendered HTML file and its accompanying support folder (`*_files/`) are also here.

- **Data folder**:  
  - `SST_update2023.csv`: Sea surface temperature data from the SBC LTER.  
  - `occdist.csv`: Nest box occupancy data used to model Swift Parrot habitat use.

- **Docs folder**:  
  This folder is used by GitHub Pages to serve the rendered HTML output.
